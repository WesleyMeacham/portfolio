This is my personal portfolio. Currently it contains links to most of the projects I've created during the web development course at Fullstack Academy. I am planning to add more later.

This site was created as a React app. All of the styling is Material UI. This was my first time using MUI.

All of the projects listed are hosted on Netlify. Within them there are examples of HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuerry, AJAX and JSON and React. In some of our projects that are not listed here we also used Express.JS, Node.JS, and PostgreSQL. This of course will change over time.
