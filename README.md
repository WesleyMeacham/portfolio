My web project portfolio

This website is intended to serve as a portfolio showcasing web development projects that I have completed. 
Not everything I have done is actually represented here but most of it is. 

This website was created as a React app using Material UI for the styling. This was my first time using MUI.
Depending on when you are visiting you may notice that all of the images on the portfolio page are broken. 
These images all worked great locally but when deployed to GitHub Pages something went awry. 
I just haven't yet taken the time to investigate why this has happened. 
If you are reading this and you know what the problem is please shoot me a message, I will appreciate the help. 

Also if you have any other questions or suggestions feel free to message me.
