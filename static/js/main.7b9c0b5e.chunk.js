While I was there I worked from lesson plans that were prewritten to follow a course which I would have to taylor to the needs of the student. After this I went to Hubei University of Economics (HBUE) for three years, where I taught ESL in a college setting. At HBUE I worked from textbooks and created all my own lesson plans.
